I'm ManyLinesOfCode. I'm an amature developer who works mainly in webdev and game design/development. I enjoy the use of GNU/Linux-based operating systems.
I have significant knowledge in the weblangs (HTML, JS, and CSS) and GDScript, but I also dabble in Ruby, x86-64 Assembly, and advanced Batch.

# I'm Currently Working On

- A website (in a private repo)
- A game in the Godot Engine
- An upcoming experiment; stay tuned!
